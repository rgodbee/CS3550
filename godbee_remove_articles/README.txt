Write two java programs: one for server and one for client, based on TCP/IP socket programming. 
Your client program should be able to accept a line from a file and send to the server. 
The server upon receiving the entire line, would remove all the articles before displaying the line.

Test your client and Server applications by transferring (i) a file having 10,000+ lines 
(see supplied big-file1.txt having 12000+ lines), (ii) a file having 20,000+ lines 
(you may create one of your own from big-file1.txt.
